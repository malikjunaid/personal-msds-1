# Today I Learned (TIL)

## Day 02 | April 02 2020 | Thursday
Today I started digging deeper into the Gradient Descent and started learning maths behind it. I learned about Linear regression with single variable and multiple variable and how Gradient Descent minimizes the cost funciton with high dimensions. Also I refreshed my Linear Algebra concepts for the course.
- Negative & Positive slopes.
- At any minima the slope is 0.
- Linear Algebra.
	- Convex function only have one minima which is global.
	- Matrix scaler operations, Addition and multiplication.
	- Matrix Multiplicaton and its properties.
	- Matrix Inverse and Transpose.
- Linear Regression for Multiple Features.
	- Gradient Descent for multiple features Linear Regression.
	- Gradient Descent converge quickly when features are scaled.
	- Effect of learning rate on convergence.
	- Plotting Cost function to check if the Gradient Descent is working right or not.
	- Polynomial Features (Feature Interactions).
- Linear Regression for Multiple Features Normal Equation.
	- Normal Equation for Linear Regression.
	- Feature Scaling is not required.
|Gradient Decent|Normal Equation|
|-----|-----|
|Need to choose Learning Rate **α**|No need to choose Learning Rate **α**|
|Needs many iterations|Don't need to iterate|
|Works well even when **n** (dataset size) is large|Need to perform intensive matrix operations|
