## ITU MS(DS) Roadmap
### Degree Structure
The MS Data Science degree at ITU will develop realworld problemsolving skills using data science, which will differ from typical classroom problems. At ITU, we believe in the solution of problems with high social impact. The curriculum will also take into consideration the needs of the industry including stakeholders in business, social media, education, health, and entertainment. The MS program will prepare students to actively contribute to various fields, related to data science, such as computer vision, big data analytics, scientometrics, artificial intelligence, highperformance computing, and computer security.
